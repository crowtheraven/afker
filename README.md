# afker

RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR. It may not work on games otherwise.

Presses a key (or group of keys) at regular intervals to keep yourself from getting kicked off from games for being afk.

Regular toggle on/off hotkey will start by pressing the keys immediately. Regular button for toggling on/off will wait for the time first then start pressing the keys. The syncing option, with either the hotkey or button, will look at the current time, wait for the nearest five seconds, then start. This is for if multiple people are using this tool and they want to synce actions.

Press change preset key to change to a different preset. The default key is home. You can edit default presets by changing the values after "default of what to type," and the default wait times by changing the number after "efault wait between typing,." You can remove presets by deleting lines or add more presets by adding new lines. The maximum amount of working presets is 10.
