# afker

RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR. It may not work on games otherwise.

Presses a key (or group of keys) at regular intervals to keep yourself from getting kicked off from games for being afk.

Regular toggle on/off hotkey will start by pressing the keys immediately. Regular button for toggling on/off will wait for the time first then start pressing the keys. Sync option will look at the current time, wait for the nearest five seconds, then start. This is for if multiple people are using this tool and they want to synce actions.
